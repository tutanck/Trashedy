/**
 * In software engineering, a fluent interface (as first coined by Eric Evans and Martin Fowler) is an implementation of an object oriented API that aims to provide more readable code.
 * A fluent interface is normally implemented by using method cascading (concretely method chaining) to relay the instruction context of a subsequent call (but a fluent interface entails more than just method chaining [1]). Generally, the context is
 * defined through the return value of a called method
 * self-referential, where the new context is equivalent to the last context
 * terminated through the return of a void context.
